# ü§µüèª About me
I am a machine learning master with research interests in Graph Neural Networks. I am now from School of Data Science and Engineering in East China Normal University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by professor Lixiang in PLANING LAB.My research interests include topics in machine learning and data mining. Most recently, I am interested in the following topics:
- Graph Neural Networks.
- Network Science.
- Data Mining.
