# 🤵🏻 About me
I am a master with research interests in Graph Neural Networks. I am now from School of Data Science and Engineering in East China Normal University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by professor Xiang Li in PLANING LAB. Most recently, I am interested in the following topics:
- Graph Neural Networks.
- Graph Representation Learning.
- Self-supervised Learning on Graphs.
- Graph Foundation Models.
